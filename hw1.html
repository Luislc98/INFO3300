    first one has error because there are quotes inside the JSON string, which violates the convention. <br>
    second one has errors: comments cannot be placed in json strings and must be removed. There cannot be multiple options in the JSON string, there can only be one option.
    Also, in order for the json string to hold a number, the quotation marks around the class name must be removed and the abbreviations(like INFO) must also be removed   <br>
    for the third one the error is that
    lists in javascript are seperated by commas not semicolons
    <br>
    for the fourth one, there is a semi colon that must be replaced instead with a colon

    The policy on late work is that late work will not be accepted with no excpetions.
    However, the two lowest homeworks will be dropped. It is also possible for a file to be accepted if there is an unalterabel timestamp that shows it was completed in time,
    like the time an email attachment was sent or a github commit.
